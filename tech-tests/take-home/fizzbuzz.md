# Fizzbuzz

## Specification

### Requirements

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

* For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
* For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
* For all other numbers, print the number itself.

## Extension

If you've completed the first part of the challenge, make it interactive via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. Your programme should request a number input and then return the corresponding value (Fizz, Buzz etc).
