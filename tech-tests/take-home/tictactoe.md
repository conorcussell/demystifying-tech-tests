# Tic Tac Toe

## Specification

### Requirements

Implement a working game of tic tac toe. You can choose to do so on any user interface (web or command line).

The rules of the game are as follows:

* There are two players - X and O.
* The game is played on a 3 x 3 grid. 
* Players alternate to place Xs and Os on the grid until either wins.
* A player can only place their piece in an empty square.
* A player's turn is over once they have placed their piece.
* The first player to get 3 of their pieces in a row (up, down, across or diagonally) wins.
* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 pieces in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Extension

Once you have fulfilled the basic functionality of the game, you can choose to implement these additional user stories.

* I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
* The game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
* I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
* I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with an unbeatable computer. (hint: you can use minimax).
