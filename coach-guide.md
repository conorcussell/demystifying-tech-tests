# Coach Guide

Your role is to ensure that the student has a clearer understanding of what to expect during a programming interview and how they should approach either a take home tech test or pairing interview.

1. Get the student(s) to pick a pairing exercise/take home tech test. Most of the exercises are backend focused except for the ones which specify that they are front end. We'd only recommend picking a pairing exercise if you're working with just 1 student.

2. Have a conversation with the student before starting to gauge their experience level and what they want to get out of the session. Some of them might just want to try a practice take home tech test with some guidance if they have never done anything like it before, others might want a go at a mock pairing interview to practice their communication.

2. Walk them through some of the best practices below before they get started on the exercise. Some of the concepts might be hard to explain within an hour (like SOLID) but feel free to introduce it to them so they can research it in their free time. During the session, try and ensure they stick to these practices.


## Some Best Practices

These are some general best practices to encourage your students to do during the session. Given the limited time, you might not be able to cover all these points in detail (writing tests for example) but it could be useful to point them in the right direction so they can work on it on their own time.

1. Sketch out a plan before starting - plan the main pieces of your program and how they might fit together.
2. TDD (test-driven development) - include unit tests.
3. Make it readable
..* Take care when naming classes, methods/functions, and variables. Names should describe what the thing does, or what it represents. Choose a name that reminds the reader what is stored inside the variable.
..* Break it down - Short and concise methods over long and complex ones.
..* Use comments sparingly - code that is easy to understand is always better than a comment.
4. Follow the programming style of your language - if you choose a OO language, make sure to write object-oriented code.
5. Make sure you are handling any edge cases (if you aren't, acknowledge these edge cases to demonstrate that you have thought about it.)
6. Refactor your solution!
7. Include a README - your documentation should include what your code will do, how to run your code and the technologies you've used. You can also talk about the problems you ran into, why you took the approach you did, what you might do differently or additionally if you had more time.

### Additional tips for Pairing Interview

1. Make sure you understand what the problem is before beginning to 'code bash'. Take your time to read and understand what you are expected to do and feel free to ask questions to clarify any doubts you might have.
2. Communicate! Pairing interviews are intended for companies to see how you think and problem solve. Try and constantly be talking through your steps and the reasons you are doing one thing over the other.
